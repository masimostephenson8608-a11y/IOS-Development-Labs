## Exercise - Numeric Type Conversion

 Create an integer constant `x` with a value of 10, and a double constant `y` with a value of 3.2. Create a constant `multipliedAsIntegers` equal to `x` times `y`. Does this compile? If not, fix it by converting your `Double` to an `Int` in the mathematical expression. Print the result.
 */
let x = 10
let y = 3.2
let multipliedAsIntegers = x * Int(y)
print(multipliedAsIntegers)
//:  Create a constant `multipliedAsDoubles` equal to `x` times `y`, but this time convert the `Int` to a `Double` in the expression. Print the result.
let multipliedAsDoubles = Double(x) * y
print(multipliedAsDoubles)
//:  Are the values of `multipliedAsIntegers` and `multipliedAsDoubles` different? Print a statement to the console explaining why.
print("Yes the values are different because when multiplied as integers, we converted value y to an integer, causing the double to round down to the nearest integer, in that case, 3. Where as when multiplied as doubles, 10 was actually multipled by 3.2.")
